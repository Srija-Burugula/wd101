# Description 
The "Registration Webpage" project is a web application that offers a user-friendly registration form featuring age validation and a subsequent display of registered user data in a table format. Users input their details including name, email, password, and date of birth, with the system enforcing an age range of 18 to 55 years. Upon successful submission, JavaScript populates the user's information into a neatly organized table that showcases Name, Email, Password, Date of Birth, and Acceptance of Terms. The project aims to provide an accessible and efficient registration experience while ensuring data accuracy and compliance with age requirements.
